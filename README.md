1. install Realsense SDK from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
2. install ROS Wrapper of Realsense from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros 
The realsense2\_camera package we got for running the Realsense camera is shown as the realsense2\_camera folder. We made some modifiction in some of the launch file
